2017/04/15 -- First few check-ins

SugarOS 6.5.x is for PHP 5.2/5.3 by default.
Here is my changelog to make it generally work with PHP 7.

The changes are so extensive that there is no way I can just write a small
ledger about them.

The main change was the 'e' flag on a preg_replace() call which is not
supported at all in PHP 7. We have to use a preg_replace_callback() instead.
This completely prevented any valid rendering from happening.

Otherwise I fixed many small bugs here and there. There are a few:

  . dynamic reference ($a->$b[$c]) now require the {} ($a->{$b[$c]})
  . missing "&" in various function declarations
  . use of & on functions returning an object
  . added __FILE__ to the "Not a Valid Entry Point" so I know which file
    causes the problem
  . quite a bit of reformatting, adding { and } for if/else blocks, etc.
